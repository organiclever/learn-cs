# Computer Science Concepts in Markdown

This directory contains explanations and pseudocode for various computer science concepts and algorithms, written in Markdown format.

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to provide clear, concise explanations of computer science concepts and algorithms without tying them to a specific programming language. This allows learners to focus on the core ideas and logic behind each concept before diving into language-specific implementations.

## Structure

Each subdirectory in this folder represents a different topic or category of algorithms. Within each subdirectory, you'll find:

- A README.md file explaining the concept or algorithm
- Pseudocode representations of the algorithms
- Explanations of time and space complexity
- Examples and use cases

## Topics Covered

Currently, the following topics are covered:

- [Search Algorithms](./search)

More topics will be added as the project grows.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the topic you're interested in learning about.
2. Read the README.md file in that directory for an overview of the concept.
3. Study the pseudocode and explanations provided.
4. Once you understand the concept, you can look at language-specific implementations in other directories of this project.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this section, please ensure your explanations are clear, concise, and accessible to learners at various levels. Pseudocode should be easy to understand and follow established conventions.
